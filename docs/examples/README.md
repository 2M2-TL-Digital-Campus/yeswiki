# Examples to customize YesWiki

Customization is available by putting files into folder `custom/`.

Here are example of files and folders to put into `custom/` with the same hierarchy from this folder.
Example :
 - Copy `docs/examples/templates/custom/custom-macro.twig` into `custom/templates/custom/custom-macro.twig` then modify its content.
 - Copy `docs/examples/styles/bazar/entry-custom.css` into `custom/styles/bazar/entry-custom.css` then modify its content.

**Particularity**:
For `fiche-x.twig` files, you must rename it with the corresponding form'id.

Example for form number `10` :
 - Copy `docs/examples/templates/bazar/fiche-x.twig` into `custom/templates/bazar/fiche-10.twig` then modify its content.
